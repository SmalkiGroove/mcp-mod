# Mod content

## Engineers and field engineers

In this mod, the 2 typs of engineers have their specific buildset.  
Basically, engieers can build economic or intelligence and field engineers can build defense. Both can build experimental mobile units.

The reason behind this is to not have off-screen buildable components like we can have with Total Mayhem, and there are so many options that most of them becom useless.

In Mixed Combat Pack, every unit or building has it's specific use case, like in the base game.

## Tech 1, 2 and 3 experimentals

Each tech level has it's experimental unit set mod mid-game superiority.

- __Mobile siege unit__ : high firepower and range, low mobility
- __Assault Bot__ : high mobility and fire rate, lower range and damage
- __Gunship__ : (buildable in air factory) high air-sol dps but weak against fighters
- __Battleship__ : (buildable in naval factory) high firepower, range and health, low mobility

With an exception for T3 experimentals gunships that are atually spaceships, thus not buildable in factories but by engineers.

## Advanced defense options

Each faction has the following items, buildable by there tier respective field engineers :
- T1 small turret (from the base game) : high dps but low range and health
- T1 heavy turret : high range and health, but expensive
- T1 polyvalent turret : can shoot ground and air, medium range and health, high dps
- T1 artillery : UEF and Cybran have rapid-fire artillery, Aeon and Seraph have light artillery
- T2 point defense (from the base game) : medium range, medium to low dps, low health
- T2 heavy point defense : high range and health, but expensive
- T2 experiental point defense : high damages, range and health
- T2 anti-navy turret : high range and damages, only attacks boats
- T3 point defense (UEF aleady has one from te base game) : medium health, pretty good damages and range
- T3 heavy point defense : very high health and range, good damages
- T3 anti-navy bunker : very high helth, damage and range, but very expensive and only attacks boats
- T3 anti-armor point defense : works like a T2 artillery without power consumption and better range and damage.
- T4 experimental point defense : very high range and damages

## Tech 1, 2 and 3 air staging

Along with the T2 airstaging platforms from the base game, there are T1 stations for 1 unit at a time that can be built almost anywhere for cheap, and tech 3 advanced stations that can be built on water with additional features :

__UEF__ : engi stations, flak anti-air, shield dome, torpedo defense...  
__Cybran__ : stealth field, torpedoes...  
__Aeon__ : AA missiles, torpedoes...  
__Seraphim__ : torpedoes, torpedo defense, drones...  

## Additionnal land units

## Additionnal buildings

(Except turrets and air staging)

__T2 and T3 hydrocarbon__ : hydrocarbon power generators from the base game can be upgraded.  
__T2 and T3 naval power generators__ : power generators built in water when deep enough.  
__T2 and T3 naval mass extractors__ : mass extractors built in water when deep enough. Doesn't need a mass source.

### UEF

__T3 satellite station__ : can create spy satellites.

### Aeon

__T3 shielded mass extractor, power generator and mass fabricator__ : same as the regular buildings but with a small shield dome that protects it and the small buildings around like mass storages.

### Cybran

__T3 cloaked mass extractor, power generator and mass fabricator__ : same as the regular buildings but with cloaking ability.

### Seraphim

__T1 T2 T3 engineering stations__ : regular engi station.  
__T3 armored mass extractor, power generator and mass fabricator__ : same as the regular buildings but with a lot more HP.  
__T3 optics facility__ : gives vision on an ennemy unit and follows it when it moves.


## Additionnal T4 experimentals

Experimentals are sorted by macro categories :

- __Fast land assault__ : Cheapest experimental and good move speed but can be stopped with some defenses and bombers (*Monkeylord*)
- __Heavy land assault__ : Medium cost, medium strength, medium speed, can handle a good amount of defenses (*Colossus*, *Ythotha*)
- __Land siege__ : Can use its range to counter defenses (*Fatboy*, *Megalith*)
- __Land ultimate__ : Very expensive and stupidly strong unit, game ender
- __Air__ : Massive air unit that can be fatal when ennemies have not enough air defense (*CZAR*, *Soul Ripper*, *Ahwassa*)
- __Naval battleship__ : Ensure water domination with huge range and tankyness (*Tempest*)
- __Strategic weapon__ : game ender building (*Mavor, Scathis, Salvation, Yolona*)
- __Point defense__ : Point defense so strong that it can fight other experimentals if not outranged

To fill the gaps in the list above, I added one experimental for each category and each faction that doesn't have one in the category already.  
There is no faction that has 2 experimentals in a same category.

# Mod changes to the base game

## Removed useless or duplicate units

- __UEF T4 sub carrier__ : because I added a T4 dreadnought and a T3 cruiser, and it's ugly and never used.
- __UEF T4 satellite system__ : because I moved it to T3 with no attack ability.
- __UEF T4 mobile factory (fatboy)__ : because the factory ability isn't really used and I replaced it with a stronger version.
- __Aeon T4 resource generator__ : because overpowered in long games and survivals.
- __Cybran T4 rapid-fire artillery__ : because replaced with a non-mobile version that shots properly.
- __T3 strategic subs__ : because I don't like them.
- __Aeon T2 guided missile__ : because it's bad and replaced by T2 tactical bomber.

## Modified units or buildings

- __UEF T3 engi station__ : can be built by tier 3 engineer.
- __Cybran engi stations__ : formerly all T2 variants, now T1, T2 and T3 and all of them can be built by the right tier engineer.
- __Air staging__ : revert the change of FAF that made air staging platforms tech 1. They are back to tech 2 and there are other T1 very small and cheap for 1 plane.
