# Mod content

## Engineers and field engineers

In this mod, the 2 typs of engineers have their specific buildset.  
Basically, engieers can build economic or intelligence and field engineers can build defense. Both can build experimental mobile units.

The reason behind this is to not have off-screen buildable components like we can have with Total Mayhem, and there are so many options that most of them becom useless.

In Mixed Combat Pack, every unit or building has it's specific use case, like in the base game.

## Tech 1, 2 and 3 experimentals

Each tech level has it's experimental unit set mod mid-game superiority.

- __Mobile siege unit__ : high firepower and range, low mobility
- __Assault Bot__ : high mobility and fire rate, lower range and damage
- __Gunship__ : (buildable in air factory) high air-sol dps but weak against fighters
- __Battleship__ : (buildable in naval factory) high firepower, range and health, low mobility

With an exception for T3 experimentals gunships that are atually spaceships, thus not buildable in factories but by engineers.

## Advanced defense options

Each faction has the following items, buildable by there tier respective field engineers :
- T1 small turret (from the base game) : high dps but low range and health
- T1 heavy turret : high range and health, lower dps
- T1 polyvalent turret : can shoot sol and air, medium range and health, high dps
- T1 artillery : UEF and Cybran have rapid-fire artillery, Aeon and Seraph have light artillery
- T2 point defense (from the base game) : medium range, medium to low dps, low health
- T2 heavy point defense : high range and health, lower dps
- T2 experiental point defense : high damages, range and health
- T2 anti-navy turret : high range and damages, only attacks boats
- T3 point defense (UEF aleady has one fro te base game) : medium health, pretty good damages and range
- T3 heavy point defense : very high health and range, good damages
- T4 experimental point defense : very high range and damages

## Tech 1, 2 and 3 air staging

Along with the T2 airstaging platfrms from the base game, there are T1 stations for 1 unit at a time that can b built almost anywhere for cheap, and tech 3 advanced stations that can be built on water with additional features :

UEF: engi stations, flak anti-air, shield dome, torpedo defense  
Cybran: stealth field, torpedoes  
Aeon: ...  
Seraphim: ...
